# Portable Hearing Aid Solar Charger


## Abstract 

With the growing percentage of the population suffering from hearing loss, an inclusive solution to an 
existing product was needed. Hearing aids running on batteries can run flat at any time without warning, 
leaving the user distressed and anxious that it could happen in undesirable situations. With the 
increasing use of renewable energy systems due to environmental reasons, disposable batteries can now 
be slowly discarded for rechargeable batteries. However, the change from disposable to rechargeable 
batteries in hearing aids is slow and often solutions are expensive. Thus, after extensive feasibility and 
product research, the implementation and development of a portable hearing aid solar charger was built 
successfully. The product can clip itself to hair, on a hat, or on any item of clothing. The research and 
implementation plan is discussed through the design of a printed circuit board as well as a 3D model. 
Applying previous knowledge to this project has brought significant experience and knowledge for both 
now and the future. A future where engineers can bring inclusive solutions for people living with a 
disability.


## Introduction 

With the current advancement in health technologies and the higher life expectancy of the population, 
a rise of people suffering from hearing losses is being noticed. Connect Hearing claims that “One in six 
Australians currently suffer from hearing loss. This number is expected to rise to one in four by 2050” 
(ConnectHearing, 2020). Furthermore, using disposable batteries to power those hearing aids must be 
stopped due to the detrimental effects it has on the environment, suffering enough as it is. 
It was only in 2016 that rechargeable batteries have been introduced in hearing aids (Hearing Savers, 2018). 
However, users tend to choose disposable batteries because of the extended battery life and often inexpensive. 
This project has the aim to power hearing aids using solar energy. The solution must be portable as well as low 
cost as well as discreet. That solar-powered hearing aids charger can be attached to any item of clothing, such 
as hats, and can also be attached to the user’s hair thanks to the hair clip provided.

## Product Description

The solution proposed must satisfy several user stories: 
-  The product must be portable so that users can easily wear it without discomfort and can be 
stored in their pocket or their bag.
- The product must be able to charge the hearing aid using renewable energy. 
- The product must be able to be attached to an item of clothing or the user’s hair. 


Therefore, the portable hearing aid solar charger consists of a solar panel in a case that allows the user 
to plug their hearing aids and charge them. The case will be equipped with hairpins that will allow the 
user to attach it to their hair, their hat, and even their top.
For protection and ease of use, the product will come in a small case with the solar panel as its lid, a 
compartment for the battery as well as a female port to plug the charging cable into the hearing aids.
